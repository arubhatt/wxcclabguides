# Introduction

In this lab exercise we are going to review best practices for how and when to use Vidcast to compliment your lab guide when introducing a new topic, showing a demonstration, and/or when describing a complex task.  

## When to include a Vidcast
> Vidcast should not replace other visual tools like animated GIFs or simple pictures.
>
> In a live lab setting, you should comment out the Vidcast videos so that you can provide the first hand instruction.  

``` 
<!-- <div style="padding-bottom:60.25%; position:relative; display:block; width: 100%">

</div> --> 
```

## Good video Guidelines
1. Keep the video short (under 2 minutes)
2. Keep the video topics single threaded 
3. Only cover the upcoming section or new topic introduction
4. Avoid using phrases that will link the videos as a series

### Video Introductions
> A description of the outcomes which will be produced by following the guide.
> 
> A brief description of architecture (if required)
>
> List of prerequisites and or tools that will be used in the lab.


### Demonstrations
> A video showing the outcome or activities that would be carried out using a tool. (Like making an outbound call or navigating a dashboard)


### Complex Tasks
> When you must navigate through several screens to accomplish a single task in a complicated UI.
