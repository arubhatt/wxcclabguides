# Introduction

In this lab exercise we are going to review best practices for how and when to use Vidcast to compliment your lab guide when introducing a new topic, showing a demonstration, and/or when describing a complicated task.  

## When to include a Vidcast
> Vidcast should not replace other visual tools like animated GIFs or simple pictures.
>
> In a live lab setting, you should comment out the Vidcast videos so that you can provide the first hand instruction.
> 
> ` `

## Good video Guidelines

2. Only cover the upcoming section or new topic introduction
3.
