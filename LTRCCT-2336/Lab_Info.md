# Introduction
Digital channels are now more impactful than ever. 
These labs are specially designed for the Cisco Live session. The primary purpose of the labs is to give a clear understanding of New Digital Channels functionality. You will learn how to create and configure Webchat and SMS. Using the debug console, you will also get a clear understanding of troubleshooting issues.
